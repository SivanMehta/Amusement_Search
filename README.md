# Finding people in an Amusment Park

Based on the /r/askscience post found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/35uljq/if_i_wanted_to_randomly_find_someone_in_an/). I choose to simply look at the results of a Monte Carlo Simulation for each.

The question asked was "if I wanted to randomly find someone in an amusement park, would my odds of finding them be greater if I stood still or roamed around?".

According to a simulation for a 100x100 "park" and a 10-unit sight radius, **roaming around would be the better option**. 
Why? According to the simulation, roaming around produces a median step requirement of 2815 steps, while having 1 person sit still produces a median step requirement of 3475 steps.
